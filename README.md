# Machine learning 1 // Statistical Measures

# Steps :

1. Opened Jupyter noteook.
2. Connecte to Kernel.
3. Worked on Excercise below.
4. Named the workbook as Machine learning 1.
5. Completed with below tasks and calculations:
6. Perform basic EDA in assignemnts.
7. Detect the outliers using following methods and remove it using methods like trimming / capping/ imputation using mean or median 
8.  a) Mean and Standard deviation 
9.  b)Percentile method 
10. c) IQR(Inter quartile range method) 
11. d) Z Score method 
12. Created a box plot and use this to determine which method seems to work best to remove outliers for this data.
13. Draw histplot to check the normality of the column(price per sqft column) and perform transformations if needed. Check the skewness and kurtosis before and after the transformation.
14. Check the correlation between all the numerical columns and plot heatmap. 
15. Draw Scatter plot between the variables to check the correlation between them.
16. Completed work and uploded file in Github.
