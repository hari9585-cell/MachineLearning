# Machine learning 1 // Statistical Measures

# Steps :

1. Opened Jupyter noteook.
2. Connecte to Kernel.
3. Worked on Excercise below.
4. Named the workbook as Machine learning 1.
5. Completed with below tasks and calculations:
6. Perform basic EDA in assignemnts.
7. Detect the outliers using following methods and remove it using methods like trimming / capping/ imputation using mean or median 
8.  a) Mean and Standard deviation 
9.  b)Percentile method 
10. c) IQR(Inter quartile range method) 
11. d) Z Score method 
12. Created a box plot and use this to determine which method seems to work best to remove outliers for this data.
13. Draw histplot to check the normality of the column(price per sqft column) and perform transformations if needed. Check the skewness and kurtosis before and after the transformation.
14. Check the correlation between all the numerical columns and plot heatmap. 
15. Draw Scatter plot between the variables to check the correlation between them.
16. Completed work and uploded file in Github.

8. Data Cleaning:Find the missing and inappropriate values, treat them appropriately. Remove all duplicate rows. Find the outliers. Replace the value 0 in age as NaN Treat the null values in all columns using any measures(removing/ replace the values with mean/median/mode)
9. Data Analysis: Filter the data with age >40 and salary<5000,Plot the chart with age and salary
Count the number of people from each place and represent it visually

10. Data Encoding:Convert categorical variables into numerical representations using techniques such as one-hot encoding, label encoding, making them suitable for analysis by machine learning algorithms.

11.Feature Scaling:After the process of encoding, perform the scaling of the features using standardscaler and minmaxscaler.

12. Completed work and uploded file in Github.
